# Air-Quality-Index
This project is focused on monitoring and analyzing the Air Quality Index (AQI) in various regions. It helps visualize pollution levels, understand air quality trends, and raise awareness about environmental health. The system gathers air quality data, processes it, and displays real-time AQI readings through a simple, user-friendly interface.

‚ú® Features
Real-time AQI data fetching

Data visualization (charts/graphs/maps)

Historical AQI trends analysis

Pollution category classification (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.)

Alerts/notifications for critical AQI levels

Responsive design for mobile and web

API integration (optional, if applicable)

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Programming Language: (e.g., Python / JavaScript / C++ / etc.)

Frameworks: (e.g., Flask, React, Django, etc.)

APIs: (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, AQICN API, custom sensors)

Visualization Libraries: (e.g., Chart.js, Matplotlib, Plotly)

Database: (e.g., SQLite, Firebase, MongoDB)

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Collect AQI data from APIs or sensors.

Process and standardize the data.

Classify the AQI levels based on standard guidelines.

Visualize the data in graphs and dashboards.

Trigger alerts if AQI exceeds safe thresholds.
